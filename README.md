# perceptron-algorithm

In this notebook, the perceptron algorithm is used to determine a linear boundary for a linearly separable dataset. The perceptron algorithm is coded from scratch, without reference to a library such as sci-kit learn.
The linear boundary that will be used is shown in the figure below. The perceptron algorithm will be used to rediscover this linear boundary without knowledge of it.

Random points are drawn from this region and labelled according to the boundary shown above. The results of this are shown below.

The perceptron algorithm can correctly determine the linear boundary that separates the two labels.
